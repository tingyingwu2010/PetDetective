Inspired from a logic game from `Lumosity`, I'm trying to find a solution or an approach to solve a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery.

For an illustration, check the following image:

In this game, using your rescue car, you need to return all the pets to their homes.
The car has a capacity limit of 4 pets, so you can have a maximum of 4 pets in the car at any time.

**Q: How to find the shortest route to return all the pets to their home?**
